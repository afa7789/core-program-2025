# Core Program Brazil 2025: Contributions

## How to add your project (PR template)

Note: Maintain the existing formatting exactly.

- Add a row to the table in "Core Program Brazil 2025 Projects" linking to your section.
- Append your full project section at the end of the file using the template.
- Keep spacing, headings, and list styles unchanged. Do not reformat existing content.

Anchor rule: Use your section heading text in lowercase with spaces replaced by hyphens. Example: `### ZK Multiverse` â†’ `#zk-multiverse`.

Table row template (copy and edit):
```markdown
| [Your Project Name](#your-project-name) ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡· | Short description of your project. |
```

Project section template (append at file end):
```markdown

### RISC Zero REVM Integration

**Contributors:**

- Antonio Viggiano - [@aviggiano](https://github.com/aviggiano)

**Project Description:**
This project demonstrates the integration between RISC Zero zkVM and the revm Ethereum Virtual Machine library, enabling zero-knowledge proof generation for EVM bytecode execution. The implementation showcases how to execute smart contracts privately while maintaining verifiable correctness through zkSNARKs, opening possibilities for private smart contract execution, EVM-compatible rollups, cross-chain verification, and auditing tools.

**Technical Stack:**

- Rust
- RISC Zero zkVM
- revm (Rust EVM implementation)
- Ethereum Virtual Machine
- Zero-Knowledge Proofs (zkSNARKs)

**Project Goals:**

- Demonstrate seamless integration between RISC Zero and revm
- Enable private smart contract execution with proof generation
- Provide foundation for EVM-compatible zero-knowledge applications
- Showcase cross-chain verification capabilities
- Create auditing tools for contract behavior verification
